    <string name="blog_rayon_title">RAYON FABRIC</string>
    <string name="blog_rayon_intro">Rayon is a versatile fiber with comfort properties similar to natural fibers. It can imitate the feel and texture of silk, wool, cotton, and linen. Rayon fabrics are soft, smooth, cool, comfortable, and highly absorbent, making them ideal for use in hot and humid climates.</string>
    <string name="blog_rayon_production_title">How Rayon is Made</string>
    <string name="blog_rayon_production">Rayon is made from wood, treated with caustic soda to form cellulose, which is then converted into a viscose solution. This solution is spun into filaments and solidified to form regenerated cellulose.</string>
    <string name="blog_rayon_washing_tips_title">Washing and Drying Tips</string>
    <string name="blog_rayon_washing_tip1">1. Hand wash rayon clothes with a mild detergent in cold water. Rayon is weak when wet and less durable than cotton.</string>
    <string name="blog_rayon_washing_tip2">2. Machine wash rayon blends on the delicate setting, but be cautious as it may damage the fabric.</string>
    <string name="blog_rayon_washing_tip3">3. Always read the label for specific washing instructions. If it says dry clean only, avoid washing at home to prevent damage or shrinkage.</string>
    <string name="blog_rayon_washing_tip4">4. Avoid hanging rayon clothes to dry as they can lose their shape. Use line drying or flat drying methods instead.</string>

    <string name="blog_ajrakh_intro">Ajrak, also known as Ajrakh, is a unique form of block printing found in Ajrakhpur, Kutch district, India. These shawls display special designs and patterns made using block printing by stamps. Ajrak prints are a symbol of Sindhi culture and traditions, and are also popular in Gujarat due to their historical roots in the Indus Valley Civilization.</string>
    <string name="blog_ajrakh_history_title">History</string>
    <string name="blog_ajrakh_history">Early human settlements in the lower Indus Valley used tree cotton to make clothes and mastered the art of making cotton fabrics. Ajrak is a symbol of pride and respect for Sindhi people and is used to honor guests. The geometric designs are created using woodblock printing.</string>
    <string name="blog_ajrakh_dyes_title">Dyes</string>
    <string name="blog_ajrakh_dyes">Ajrak products are made with natural dyes, including both vegetable and mineral dyes. Indigo is a key dye used in the production process.</string>
    <string name="blog_ajrakh_blocks_title">Ajrak Blocks</string>
    <string name="blog_ajrakh_blocks">Common Ajrak patterns include dots between two lines, often created with brass nails. The designs are influenced by Mughal-era geometry and Muslim architectural elements, with patterns formed by the interaction of circles and the use of a grid system.</string>
